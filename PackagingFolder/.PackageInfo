summary			"A zip utility with a minimalist interface"
Description			"Well, what can I say? Run it and follow the tooltip :-)

Version 0.3 gets a new, more conventional interface. The border is thicker to make it easier to move it around, and there are now three buttons rather than using only mouseclicks.

To move ZD, you grab it by the edge. It's a bit tricky but it can be done. Quit ZD (see below) and it will remember its position.

Drag files and folders onto ZD's yellow dropzone to start your collection. You can add as many as you like. Folders will be zipped with all their contents, recursively. Unlike Zip-o-Matic, ZipDropper always zips  the whole pathname, from /boot onwards. This makes it better suited for making quick backups that can be restored by unzipping them back to /boot.

You can View your collection at any time with the View button. At least the first 15 entries, after that the dialog runs out of screen space.

When you are ready to zip the collection, click on the Zip button. Sorry, two-button mouse owners (both of you?). If you select an existing zip file, it will be freshened and any new files will be added to it. Yest the file dialog says it will be replaced, but there's nothing I can do about it. Trust me, it will be freshened. After the files have been zipped, the current collection of files-to-be-zipped is cleared and you can start on a new one.

To quit, right-click on the yellow dropzone or click the Exit button. You will be asked if you want to quit or to clear the current collection.

ZD is set to appear on all Workspaces but not in the Deskbar. It remembers its position. Install it, put a link to it in /boot/home/config/boot/launch and you won't believe it's not a replicant :-)
